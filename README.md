**`Software Engineer(MERN Stack) && Mechatronics Engineer`**

I was the student other kids went to at my high school when they had problems with their laptop or phone. I was the go-to guy to solve any technological issues. 👲 Not much has changed since then. I continue to be the go-to guy for technical issues. The difference is that I now develop ground-breaking softwares to address the issues you face.
